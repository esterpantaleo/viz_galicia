This repository contains a poster (61 x 91 cms) produced in collaboration with Victor Fresco-Barbeito, Universidade de Vigo, a Galician filologist. 

The purpose of this poster is to show how all European countries are interconnected through their own local languages, and in particular how Galicia, an autonomous community of Spain, is connected with the rest of Europe. This message of interconnession is especially important now that Galicia's independence movement is making its voice louder.

The poster shows, on a map of Galicia, the etymology of the main toponyms: Santiago de Compostela, A Coruña, Ourense, Vigo, Pontevedra, Lug, and Ferrol. The etymology of the seven major cities of Galicia is connected with that of a number of other European cities: from English Greenwhich and Gatwick, to French Orlèans and German Österreich, as well as to a number of Bielorussian, Catalan, Welsh, Czech... and other languages (44 of them!).

In Europe we all speak the same language.
